"""
Rule-based name detection for UK medical records.

Strategy (in order of confidence):
1. Title-anchored names: "Dr Smith", "Mr Jones", "Mrs Williams" etc.
   These are very reliable and cover the vast majority of names in clinical notes.
2. Context-anchored names: "patient's daughter Jane", "carer Michael" etc.
3. UK common first-name list matching for capitalised words in certain contexts.
4. "Dear [Name]" patterns (referral letters).

No ML libraries required - works on any Python version.
